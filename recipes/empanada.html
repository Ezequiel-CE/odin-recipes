    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>4 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>½ cup shortening</li>
      <li>1 ¼ cups water, or as needed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1 ½ pounds ground beef</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons paprika</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon cumin</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>½ cup raisins</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon white vinegar</li>
      <li>2 hard-cooked eggs, peeled and chopped</li>
      <li>1 quart oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, stir together the flour and salt. Cut in shortening
        using a pastry blender, or pinching into small pieces using your
        fingers, until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Use a fork to stir
        in water a few tablespoons at a time, until the mixture forms a ball.
        Pat into a ball, and flatten slightly. Wrap in plastic wrap and
        refrigerate for 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook
        until tender. Crumble in the beef, and season with salt, paprika, cumin
        and black pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until beef is browned.
        Drain excess grease, and stir in the raisins and vinegar. Refrigerate
        until chilled, then stir in the hard-cooked eggs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Form the dough into 2 inch balls. On a floured surface, roll each ball
        out into a thin circle. Spoon some of the meat mixture onto the center,
        then fold into half-moon shapes. Seal edges by pressing with your
        fingers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C). Place one or
        two pies into the fryer at a time. Cook for about 5 minutes, turning
        once to brown on both sides. Drain on paper towels, and serve hot.
